The admin portal provides various services for MOSIP administrators such as Login, Account management, Resource Management, Master data management and Packet status check based on RID.

# Packet Status Service
The packet status service allows us to view the status of a packet by giving the RID of the packet. The packet status will contain all the stages the packet has passed through along with the last stage the packet is in. In case the packet has not been processed or is marked for Re-Send/Re-Register, the admin will be able to view specific comments indicating the reason for that particular status.
